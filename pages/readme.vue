      ## Some context

      This is a way for me to give a recruiter, manager, team mate (present or future) some context of who I am and what I'm about.
      
      ## About Me

      This is not a resume, just a high level over view.

      ### Personal

      - I have travelled extensively and lived in a number of countries and states.

      - I love to snowboard, surf and wakeboard and don't do it nearly as much as I'd like to.

      - I value family, friends, creativity, thought, care, exercise, disciplined practice, meditation.

      - I want to have a meaningful live and postively impact others around me.

      ### Professional

      - I am full stack developer, but often find myself tinkering with the frontend.

      - My primary language is JavaScript. I can also write PHP, Python and I am happy to learn any other language or framework aslong as I am given the time and resources to do so.

      - I have used strongly typed languages and enjoy using them

      - I like to work in teams that communicate well and open the doors to collabaration.

      - A big motivator for me is being given a small section of the work week to improve my skillset relevant to the job at hand.

      - I really do love writing code and always strive to make it readable and maintainable. 
      
      ## My Current Toolbelt:

      - Node on the server side. I am open to new approaches and languages.
      
      - Databases - whatever SQL or NoSQL is just fine.
      
      - I quite like Vue on the front end but have used React alongside TypeScript.

      - I generally deploy to Digital Ocean, but would like to learn AWS.

      - For managing projects, I just fit-in with whatever the team is using.

      - I use Linux for an OS, I can use other systems but I would rather not.
    

      That's about it, thank you!
